//! The per-tick decision for a CPU-tier KV prefetch query.
//!
//! `begin_kv_prefetch` (first query) and `poll_remote_fetch` (re-query while
//! parked in [`RemoteFetch`](super::PrefetchPhase::RemoteFetch)) share one
//! cascade: still loading → wait; timeout / zero-hit / query error → prefill
//! from scratch; leased hit past the reservation budget → release the lease
//! and prefill from scratch; leased hit within budget → start the H2D load.
//! This module owns that cascade so the two call sites cannot drift, and so
//! the timeout / zero-hit / budget branches are testable without a GPU, an
//! RDMA fabric, or a MetaServer (only *injecting* a real `Loading` needs
//! those; deciding on one does not).
//!
//! The lease type is generic: every branch that receives a lease must route
//! it into the returned action, so a silently dropped (never-released) lease
//! is unrepresentable. Production monomorphizes `L` to pegaflow's opaque
//! `QueryLeaseId`; tests use plain integers.

/// A lease-carrying view of [`QueryOutcome`](openinfer_kv_offload::QueryOutcome),
/// decoupled from pegaflow types so the decision stays constructible in tests.
///
/// `lease: None` only occurs together with `num_blocks == 0` (the engine
/// builds a lease for every non-empty hit); the pair is kept as-is rather
/// than re-encoded because the decision treats every `None` as a miss.

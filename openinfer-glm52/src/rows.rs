//! Row-batched device buffer whose column width is a type fact.
//!
//! The step scratch used to carry `[T, C]` buffers as untyped `DeviceVec`s,
//! and every consumer re-validated `len == tokens * C` at its own entrance —
//! ~30 `ensure!`s all re-checking what the allocation already established.
//! `Rows<C>` moves the invariant to the construction point: the width is a
//! `const` type parameter, the row count travels with the buffer, and
//! `len == tokens * C` holds by construction. Receivers read the row count
//! from the value and the width from the type instead of re-validating
//! either, and passing a `[T, HIDDEN]` buffer where `[T, VOCAB]` is expected
//! stops compiling.
//!
//! TP note: the widths are compile-time because TP1 is the only supported
//! layout (the whole crate pins its shapes to `config.rs` constants). If a
//! sharded layout ever lands, the const parameter becomes a dimension tag
//! whose per-rank width lives in a rank config — the construction-time
//! invariant and the typed signatures survive that move unchanged.

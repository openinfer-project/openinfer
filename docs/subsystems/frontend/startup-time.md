# Server startup-to-ready time

**TL;DR**: Qwen3-4B warm (page-cache-hot) startup-to-HTTP-ready cut 3.25s → ~1.45s by (1) loading the engine on a blocking thread so the vLLM frontend's ~1.15s tokenizer/chat-template load runs concurrently, and (2) moving the ~0.4s munmap page-table teardown of the touched source mmap off the allocation hot path (since #377 it is paid once at the end of the load function). Readiness semantics unchanged: HTTP binds only after the engine bridge registers. 2026-07: the engine path has since outgrown the frontend overlap, and the once-rejected pinned-staging upload is adopted (warm ready 5.22s → 4.66s on sm_89) — see below.

## Warm-start breakdown (RTX 5070 Ti, Qwen3-4B, 8GB bf16)

Baseline 3.25s was three serial phases:

| Phase | Cost | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine load (CUDA ctx 0.18s + H2D upload ~1.1s @ ~7GB/s pageable) | 1.3s | pageable at the time; pinned staging adopted 2026-07 — see below |
| munmap of the 8GB touched source mmap | 0.42s | dropped at the end of the load function since #377 |
| vLLM frontend: tokenizer (11MB tokenizer.json) + text/chat backends | 1.15s | runs concurrently with engine load |

After: engine path ~1.35s and frontend path ~1.25s overlap; ready ≈ max of the two + process start ≈ 1.45s.

## The munmap trap

munmap of ~8GB of touched pages costs ~0.4s of kernel page-table teardown holding the process mmap lock. Dropping the mmaps "in the background" just moves the stall to whatever allocates next — cudaMalloc (KV cache), cuBLAS init on the worker thread, or first-decode graph capture all take the same lock. We measured the 0.4s gap migrating from `kv_budget` → `KvCacheManager::new` → `RankWorker::spawn` as the drop point moved. The 2026-06 fix kept the mapping alive for the model's lifetime; #377 later changed this to an explicit drop at the end of the load function (after the `GPU model loaded` timing log), so the teardown is paid once before profiling starts instead of at an arbitrary later allocation point.

## Concurrent startup invariant (openinfer-vllm-frontend)

`serve()` takes `impl Future<Output = Result<EngineHandle>>`. vllm-server starts immediately (loads tokenizer, then waits in `EngineCoreClient::connect` for the engine to register); a spawned task awaits the engine and runs the `LocalEngineBridge`. Invariant chain: bridge registers (reporting `max_model_len` in the ready handshake) → vllm-server builds the router → HTTP binds. So a reachable port still means the engine can serve. Request-length limits are enforced by vllm-text natively from the reported `max_model_len` (prompt-too-long error + `max_tokens` clamp), and the scheduler rejects prompt+`max_tokens` overflow via `RejectReason::ContextLength` — there is no separate HTTP-layer guard.

Consequences to keep in mind:

- The bootstrapped-transport `ready_timeout` now bounds the **whole engine load** (it used to start after load). It is 30min so multi-GPU MoE loads and cold starts fit; load *failure* cancels the server immediately via the engine task, the timeout only catches a truly hung load.
- The graceful ctrl-c handler is installed only **after** the engine load resolves (`cancel_token_on_ctrl_c`). The blocking load can't be cancelled, so during load SIGINT keeps its default kill behavior — same as before the change. (When testing this: background jobs of non-interactive shells inherit SIGINT=SIG_IGN; use a spawner that restores default dispositions.)
- LoRA mode stays sequential: the LoRA routes need the handle when the router is built.

## Pinned-staging H2D upload (rejected 2026-06, adopted 2026-07)

The 2026-06 rejection reasoned from the numbers above: upload ran at ~7GB/s pageable, and with the engine path (~1.35s) barely above the concurrent frontend path (~1.25s), a faster upload stood to gain ≲0.1s of HTTP-ready. By 2026-07 the engine path had grown far past that floor (warm HTTP-ready ~5.2s on sm_89), so the frontend overlap no longer hides the upload: the pinned double-buffer pipeline (`WeightStager` in openinfer-core) cuts the warm Qwen3-4B load phase ~1.26s → ~0.69s and HTTP-ready 5.22s → 4.66s — the phase saving passes through in full. (The timed load phase ends at the `GPU model loaded` log, before the mmap teardown; HTTP-ready includes everything.) Cold ready stays storage-bound (5.39s → 5.33s on local NVMe). On dual-GH200 Qwen3-14B TP2 the picture is platform-dependent: pageable copies over NVLink-C2C are already fast, so the pipeline wins there only once the strided column-shard gather lands with it (warm rank-0 load 1.19s → 0.69s vs main; the intermediate gather-only state regresses to 1.33s), validated by the TP2 golden gate with the page cache warm and cold.

## Next

The warm HTTP-ready floor is now the engine's own post-load startup work (profile, warmup, graph capture — ~3.7s of the ~4.7s), no longer the frontend path; that is where the next startup-time win lives. Cold-start stays bandwidth-bound (per roadmap out of scope).
